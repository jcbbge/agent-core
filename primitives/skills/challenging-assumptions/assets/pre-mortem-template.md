## Example: VPS Migration Pre-Mortem

**Project:** Migrate from AWS to VPS  
**Timeline:** It's 6 months from now  
**Status:** Migration has failed

### Failure Story
The server went down during a traffic spike. I was at a conference with spotty WiFi. By the time I could SSH in, we'd lost 4 hours of uptime. 15 customers churned immediately.

The incident revealed our backup system wasn't actually working—we discovered this when we needed it most. I spent the next week firefighting, migrating back to managed hosting at 3x the cost in panic mode.

The "95% cost savings" ended up costing us $15K in lost revenue and emergency migrations. I'm exhausted, customers are angry, and I'm 6 weeks behind on product development.

### What went wrong?
- **Technical:** Inadequate monitoring, single point of failure, untested backups
- **Resource:** Underestimated ops time, no backup availability during travel
- **Assumption:** "It won't break," "I can handle this," "backups are working"
- **External:** Traffic spike during my unavailability

### Warning signs missed:
1. Never tested backup restore process
2. No redundancy or failover plan
3. Assumed availability during conference season
4. Didn't account for time cost of operations
5. No documented incident response procedures

### Preventive actions:
**Technical:**
1. Set up comprehensive monitoring before migration
2. Test backup/restore process thoroughly
3. Build redundancy and failover systems
4. Create gradual migration with rollback plan

**Resource:**
1. Calculate true time cost including ops burden
2. Arrange backup support coverage for travel
3. Build operational runbooks for common tasks
4. Set up emergency contact/escalation

**Process:**
1. Dry-run entire migration in staging
2. Load testing before production cutover
3. Document incident response playbook
4. Schedule regular disaster recovery tests

### Decision: Modify approach
Proceed with migration BUT:
- Test everything in staging first
- Migrate gradually (dev → staging → production)
- Maintain AWS as hot backup for first 3 months
- Document all ops procedures before cutover
- Arrange support coverage with another developer
