## Lateral Thinking (Edward de Bono)

### Core Concept
Systematic methods for breaking linear thought patterns through deliberate provocations and perspective shifts.

### Key Techniques

#### 1. Random Entry
**Method**: Force connection between random concept and problem.

**Process**:
1. Pick random word/object (use random number + dictionary, or physical object)
2. List attributes of random concept
3. Force connections to target problem
4. Extract useful insights

**Example**:
```
Problem: Improve restaurant reservation system
Random word: "Lighthouse"

Lighthouse attributes:
- Guides ships to safety
- Periodic rotating beam
- Visible from great distance
- Warning system

Forced connections:
- What if reservations "guided" users to optimal times?
- What if availability rotated/changed to balance load?
- What if restaurant was "visible" across multiple platforms?
- What if system warned about busy periods in advance?

Insight: Dynamic pricing + visibility optimization + proactive guidance
```

#### 2. Provocation Operators

**PO (Provocative Operation)**: Deliberately false statement to break patterns.

**Operators**:
- **Reversal**: "PO: Customers pay the restaurant to NOT serve them"
- **Exaggeration**: "PO: Restaurant seats 10,000 people"
- **Distortion**: "PO: Dinner happens before lunch"
- **Escape**: "PO: No kitchen needed"
- **Wishful Thinking**: "PO: Food appears instantly when desired"

**Process**:
1. State provocation clearly
2. Suspend judgment
3. Extract movement (how does this lead somewhere useful?)
4. Develop practical direction

**Example**:
```
PO: "Customers pay to NOT eat"

Movement:
- What if we charged for the experience, not the food?
- What if scarcity increased value?
- What if "not available" created demand?

Practical direction:
- Reservation fees that reduce no-shows
- Limited-menu concept restaurants
- Pre-payment model like theater tickets
```

#### 3. Challenge
**Method**: Question why things are done the current way.

**Not**: Criticism or judgment
**Is**: Curiosity-driven investigation

**Template**: "Why do we [X]? What alternatives exist?"

**Example**:
```
Challenge: "Why do restaurants have menus?"

Exploration:
- Menus communicate options → What else communicates options?
- Menus manage expectations → What if expectations were dynamic?
- Menus limit choices → What if choices were unlimited?

Alternative models:
- Trust-based ("chef decides")
- Conversational ("tell me what you want, I'll create it")
- Algorithmic ("based on your preferences and our ingredients")
```

#### 4. Alternatives
**Method**: Generate alternatives to accepted concepts, not just solutions.

**Focus**: Conceptual alternatives, not just implementation variations.

**Example**:
```
Accepted concept: "Project deadline"

Conceptual alternatives:
- Continuous delivery (no deadline, constant shipping)
- Event-based completion (done when condition met, not date)
- Scope-flexible (deadline fixed, scope adjusts)
- Iterative milestones (many small deadlines vs. one big)
- Negotiated endpoint (collaborative determination vs. imposed)

Each alternative reveals different assumptions and possibilities.
```

## TRIZ Inventive Principles

### Core Concept
40 universal principles derived from patent analysis, used to resolve contradictions systematically.

### Selected Principles for Exploration

#### Principle 1: Segmentation
**Divide object into independent parts**

**Applications**:
- Microservices instead of monolith
- Modular furniture instead of fixed
- Unbundled pricing instead of package deals

#### Principle 2: Extraction
**Extract disturbing part or property**

**Applications**:
- Move processing to cloud (extract computation from device)
- Outsource non-core functions
- Separate concerns in architecture

#### Principle 5: Consolidation
**Bring together identical or similar objects**

**Applications**:
- Unified dashboard for multiple tools
- Platform aggregating fragmented services
- Single API for multiple backends

#### Principle 13: Inversion
**Invert action or make object upside down**

**Applications**:
- User teaches AI instead of AI teaching user
- Pay per non-use instead of per use
- Start with constraints, add freedom (vs. start free, add constraints)

#### Principle 15: Dynamicity
**Make rigid structures flexible**

**Applications**:
- Configuration instead of hard-coding
- Adaptive interfaces instead of static
- Dynamic pricing instead of fixed

#### Principle 17: Moving to New Dimension
**Move from linear to planar, planar to spatial**

**Applications**:
- 2D spreadsheet → 3D data cube
- Sequential process → parallel workflow
- Single-threaded → multi-threaded

#### Principle 22: Convert Harm into Benefit
**Use harmful factor to achieve positive effect**

**Applications**:
- Use friction to increase engagement (desirable difficulty)
- Use waste heat for energy
- Use errors as learning signals

#### Principle 24: Mediator
**Use intermediary object to transfer action**

**Applications**:
- API layer between services
- Marketplace between buyers/sellers
- Translation layer between incompatible systems

#### Principle 25: Self-Service
**Make object serve itself**

**Applications**:
- Self-healing systems
- Auto-scaling infrastructure
- Self-documenting code

#### Principle 35: Transformation of Properties
**Change physical or chemical state**

**Applications**:
- Solid → liquid → gas (ice → water → steam)
- Fixed → flexible → adaptive
- Manual → automated → autonomous

### Using TRIZ for Exploration

**Process**:
1. Identify contradiction ("We want X but it causes Y")
2. Find applicable principles from above
3. Apply principle to generate ideas
4. Adapt and refine

**Example**:
```
Contradiction: "We want detailed user analytics but it slows down the app"

Applicable principles:
- #2 Extraction: Extract analytics processing to backend
- #17 New Dimension: Add time dimension (batch processing vs. real-time)
- #24 Mediator: Use analytics service as intermediary
- #25 Self-Service: Make analytics collect asynchronously

Generated ideas:
- Edge computing for analytics
- Background jobs for heavy processing
- Sampling instead of full capture
- Client-side aggregation, server-side details
```

## Conceptual Blending

### Core Concept
Novel ideas emerge from blending mental spaces, creating emergent structure not present in either source.

### Blending Process

#### 1. Identify Mental Spaces
**Input Space 1**: First concept/domain
**Input Space 2**: Second concept/domain
**Generic Space**: Shared abstract structure
**Blended Space**: Novel combination with emergent properties

#### 2. Cross-Space Mapping
Map corresponding elements between input spaces.

**Example**:
```
Input Space 1: Restaurant
- Servers
- Menu
- Tables
- Kitchen
- Payment

Input Space 2: Software development
- Developers
- Requirements
- Workstations
- Code repository
- Billing

Generic Space: Service provision
- Service providers
- Service catalog
- Service delivery location
- Service creation space
- Compensation mechanism
```

#### 3. Selective Projection
Choose which elements from each space to include in blend.

#### 4. Emergent Structure
Novel properties that arise from the blend, not present in either input.

**Example Blend: "Restaurant-style software development"**
```
Blend elements:
- Developers work in open kitchen (visible to clients)
- Requirements presented as menu (standardized options + custom)
- Workstations as tables (communal or private)
- Code repository as shared cooking space
- Billing as tip-based (performance-linked compensation)

Emergent properties:
- Transparency as default (clients watch code being written)
- Standardized components with customization (menu engineering)
- Performance-based compensation (skin in the game)
- Communal creation space (pair programming default)
```

### Applications for Exploration

**Pattern**: Blend [Domain A] with [Domain B] to create novel approach to [Problem].

**Examples**:
- Blend "video game" + "fitness" = Gamified workout apps
- Blend "social network" + "learning" = Collaborative education platforms
- Blend "subscription box" + "software" = SaaS model
- Blend "theme park" + "retail" = Experiential stores

### Using Biomimicry for Exploration

**Process**:
1. Define function needed (not solution)
2. Ask "How does nature [function]?"
3. Identify organism/ecosystem with that function
4. Extract pattern (structure, process, behavior, material)
5. Abstract to principles
6. Apply to target domain

**Example**:
```
Function needed: Efficiently filter relevant information from noise

Nature's solution: Baleen whale feeding
- Structure: Baleen plates act as comb filter
- Process: Large mouth intake, filter retention, waste expulsion
- Efficiency: Processes tons of water for small nutritious organisms

Pattern extraction:
- Coarse filter first (large mesh catches big items)
- Fine filter second (small mesh catches target items)
- Continuous flow, parallel processing
- Waste passes through without clogging

Application to email filtering:
- Coarse filter: Known spam domains (baleen plates)
- Fine filter: Content analysis (small mesh)
- Parallel processing of high volume
- False positives flow to separate stream (not deleted)

Novel insight: Two-stage filtering with different mesh sizes
```

## Design Thinking Divergent Protocols

### Core Concept
Separate divergent (generating options) from convergent (selecting options) thinking to maximize creative output.

### Stanford d.school 5-Stage Process

#### Stage 1: Empathize (Divergent)
**Goal**: Understand user needs deeply.

**Methods**:
- Immersive observation
- Interview with open questions
- Experience the problem yourself
- Shadow users in context

**Divergent Approach**: Gather wide range of user stories, don't filter yet.

#### Stage 2: Define (Convergent)
**Goal**: Synthesize insights into point of view.

**Methods**:
- Affinity clustering of observations
- Identify patterns and themes
- Craft "How Might We" questions
- Define problem statement

**Transition**: Many observations → focused problem definition.

#### Stage 3: Ideate (Divergent)
**Goal**: Generate maximum quantity and variety of ideas.

**Principles**:
- Defer judgment
- Encourage wild ideas
- Build on others' ideas
- Stay focused on topic
- One conversation at a time
- Be visual
- Go for quantity

**Methods**:
- Brainstorming (quantity over quality)
- Brainwriting (silent individual ideation)
- SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse)
- Worst possible idea (then invert)
- Analogies and metaphors

**Quantity Targets**: 100+ ideas in ideation session.

#### Stage 4: Prototype (Convergent + Divergent)
**Goal**: Build to think, learn through making.

**Principles**:
- Start crude, refine later
- Build to learn, not to pitch
- Fail fast and cheap
- Prototype thinking tools (not just physical objects)

**Divergent Aspect**: Try multiple prototype directions.

#### Stage 5: Test (Convergent + Divergent)
**Goal**: Learn what works and what doesn't.

**Principles**:
- Test with real users
- Show, don't tell
- Create experiences, not just presentations
- Ask users to reflect out loud

**Divergent Aspect**: Each test reveals new possibilities.

### Divergent Thinking Exercises

#### Exercise 1: "How Might We" Questions
Transform problems into opportunity questions.

**Format**: "How might we [action] [user/context] [outcome]?"

**Example**:
```
Problem: "Users don't complete onboarding"

HMW questions:
- How might we make onboarding so engaging users complete it eagerly?
- How might we eliminate the need for onboarding entirely?
- How might we make incomplete onboarding still valuable?
- How might we turn onboarding into a game users want to play?
- How might we learn from users who DO complete onboarding?
```

#### Exercise 2: Crazy 8s
8 rapid sketches in 8 minutes (1 minute each).

**Rules**:
- No thinking, just drawing
- No judgment
- One idea per sketch
- Increasing wildness encouraged

**Goal**: Bypass analytical brain, access intuitive creativity.

#### Exercise 3: SCAMPER Framework
Systematic ideation through modification prompts.

**Prompts**:
- **Substitute**: What can be replaced?
- **Combine**: What can be merged?
- **Adapt**: What can be adjusted to serve another purpose?
- **Modify/Magnify/Minify**: What can be changed in size/shape/attributes?
- **Put to other uses**: How can this serve different purposes?
- **Eliminate**: What can be removed?
- **Reverse/Rearrange**: What can be flipped or reordered?

**Example**:
```
Target: Email client

Substitute: Voice messages instead of text
Combine: Email + calendar + tasks in one view
Adapt: Social media interactions adapted to email
Modify: Email that expires after reading
Put to other uses: Email client as CRM
Eliminate: No subject lines
Reverse: Recipients write emails, sender just approves
```
