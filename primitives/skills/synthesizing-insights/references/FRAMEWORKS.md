## Structure-Mapping Theory

**Originator:** Dedre Gentner (1983)  
**Core insight:** Analogical reasoning works by aligning relational structures, not surface features.

### Key Principles

**1. Systematicity Principle**
Prefer mappings that connect structured systems of relations over isolated attribute matches.

**Example:**
- Good analogy: Solar system : atom :: sun : nucleus (relational structure: central massive object with smaller objects in orbit)
- Poor analogy: Solar system : atom :: hot : small (surface feature match, no relational structure)

**2. One-to-One Mapping**
Each element in source domain should map to exactly one element in target domain.

**3. Parallel Connectivity**
If two relations are mapped, their arguments should also be mapped consistently.

### Structure-Mapping Process

**Step 1: Structural Alignment**
Identify corresponding relational structures between source and target domains.

**Step 2: Candidate Inference Generation**
Use aligned structure to generate predictions about target domain based on source domain knowledge.

**Step 3: Evaluation**
Assess mapping based on systematicity (connected structure preferred) and factual correctness.

### Application to Synthesis

Use Structure-Mapping when:
- Transferring knowledge from familiar to unfamiliar domain
- Need to predict behavior in new context based on analogy
- Want to validate that apparent similarity has structural basis

**Practical tip:** Explicitly map relationships, not just objects. Ask "What relates to what?" rather than "What looks like what?"

## Integrative Thinking

**Originator:** Roger Martin  
**Core insight:** Hold opposing models in tension to create better solutions than either alone.

### Four-Stage Process

**Stage 1: Articulation**
Clearly state both opposing models or perspectives.

**Technique:** Pro-Pro Chart
- List advantages of Option A
- List advantages of Option B (not disadvantages of A)
- Forces you to see genuine strengths in both

**Stage 2: Examination**
Analyze what makes each model work and where it applies.

**Key questions:**
- What assumptions underlie each model?
- What aspects of reality does each model emphasize?
- Where does each model succeed? Where does it fail?
- What causal relationships does each model claim?

**Stage 3: Exploration**
Search for creative resolutions that preserve key elements of both models.

**Strategies:**
- **Sequencing:** Apply model A in situation X, model B in situation Y
- **Layering:** Use model A at one level, model B at another
- **Synthesis:** Create new model incorporating insights from both
- **Transcendence:** Find higher-order principle that explains both

**Stage 4: Decision**
Choose or create integrated solution that's better than either original option.

### Application to Synthesis

Use Integrative Thinking when:
- Facing apparent contradictions or trade-offs
- Multiple stakeholders have conflicting but valid perspectives
- Need to move beyond either/or thinking
- Want to create novel solutions from existing approaches

**Warning:** Don't force integration when genuine trade-offs exist. Some contradictions are real.

## Systems Thinking

**Key figures:** Donella Meadows, Peter Senge  
**Core insight:** Understand complex phenomena through interconnections, feedback, and emergent properties.

### Core Concepts

**1. Stock and Flow**
- **Stock:** Accumulation of something (inventory, knowledge, reputation)
- **Flow:** Rate of change of stock (production rate, learning rate, reputation changes)
- **Key insight:** Stocks buffer flows; flows change stocks

**2. Feedback Loops**

**Reinforcing (Positive) Feedback:**
- Change amplifies itself
- Example: Network effects, compound growth, vicious/virtuous cycles
- Creates exponential growth or collapse

**Balancing (Negative) Feedback:**
- Change triggers counteraction that stabilizes system
- Example: Thermostats, market equilibrium, homeostasis
- Creates stability and goal-seeking behavior

**3. Delays**
Time lag between action and effect creates misunderstanding and overshoot.

**Common pattern:** Problem → Solution applied → Delay → No visible effect → More solution applied → Delay ends → Too much solution → Overcorrection

**4. System Archetypes**

**Fixes That Fail:**
Quick fix addresses symptom, not underlying problem. Problem returns, often worse.

**Shifting the Burden:**
System becomes dependent on symptomatic solution, weakening fundamental solution capability.

**Limits to Growth:**
Reinforcing loop of growth encounters balancing loop (limit). Growth slows or stops.

**Tragedy of the Commons:**
Multiple actors exploiting shared resource for individual gain leads to resource depletion.

### Emergence and Self-Organization

**Emergence:** System exhibits properties that component parts don't have.

**Indicators of emergence:**
- System behavior can't be predicted from parts alone
- New capabilities appear at system level
- Properties change when you break system into pieces

**Self-organization:** System develops structure and patterns without external direction.

### Application to Synthesis

Use Systems Thinking when:
- Multiple interacting elements create complex behavior
- Need to understand dynamic patterns over time
- Want to identify leverage points for intervention
- Seeing problems that resist simple solutions

**Key questions for systems synthesis:**
- What reinforces or balances what?
- Where are the delays between action and effect?
- What patterns repeat at different scales?
- What emerges from interactions that no single part produces?

## Conceptual Blending Theory

**Originators:** Gilles Fauconnier & Mark Turner  
**Core insight:** Creativity and meaning emerge from blending mental spaces.

### Blending Network Structure

**Input Spaces:** Two or more mental spaces with partial structure
**Generic Space:** Abstract structure shared by inputs
**Blended Space:** New mental space integrating elements from inputs with emergent structure

### Example: "Computer virus"

**Input 1 (Virus):** Biological agent, self-replicates, spreads between hosts, causes harm
**Input 2 (Computer program):** Software code, executes on computers, can copy itself
**Generic Space:** Autonomous entity that reproduces and affects host system
**Blend:** Software that self-replicates, spreads between computers, causes damage
**Emergent property:** Concept of digital infection that maps biological intuitions onto software

### Blending Principles

**1. Cross-Space Mapping**
Selective projection of elements from input spaces into blend.

**2. Generic Space**
Capture shared abstract structure (not always obvious or simple).

**3. Blending and Composition**
Blend composes elements in ways not present in inputs.

**4. Completion**
Background frames and scenarios elaborate the blend.

**5. Elaboration**
Run the blend (simulate, extend, develop implications).

### Application to Synthesis

Use Conceptual Blending when:
- Creating novel concepts from existing ideas
- Need metaphor to understand unfamiliar domain
- Want to combine insights from different fields
- Looking for creative innovations

**Process:**
1. Identify input spaces (domains or concepts to blend)
2. Find generic space (shared abstract structure)
3. Selectively project elements into blend
4. Notice emergent structure in blend
5. Elaborate and test the blend

**Warning:** Not all blends are useful. Test whether emergent properties add value or insight.

## Transfer Learning Principles

**Core insight:** Knowledge learned in one context can apply to different but related contexts.

### Types of Transfer

**1. Positive Transfer**
Knowledge from source domain helps in target domain.

**Example:** Programming experience in one language helps learning another language.

**2. Negative Transfer**
Knowledge from source domain interferes with target domain.

**Example:** Driving habits from one country confuse driving in country with different rules.

**3. Zero Transfer**
Knowledge from source domain neither helps nor hinders target domain.

### Conditions for Successful Transfer

**Similarity of Structure:**
Deep structural similarity matters more than surface similarity.

**Good transfer:** Chess strategy → business strategy (both involve anticipating opponent moves, controlling key positions)

**Poor transfer:** Chess → checkers (despite surface similarity, strategic principles differ significantly)

**Abstraction Level:**
Too specific = doesn't transfer; too abstract = doesn't apply.

**Optimal:** Mid-level abstractions that capture pattern but remain actionable.

**Relevant Features:**
Identify which features of source domain are relevant to target domain.

### Transfer Process

**Step 1: Abstract the pattern**
Extract general principle from source domain.

**Step 2: Identify analogous elements**
Map source domain elements to target domain elements.

**Step 3: Apply adapted principle**
Modify principle to account for target domain differences.

**Step 4: Test and refine**
Validate that transfer actually works in target domain.

### Application to Synthesis

Use Transfer Learning when:
- Have expertise in one domain, entering related domain
- Want to apply proven solutions to new contexts
- Need to generalize from specific examples
- Testing if pattern from one context applies elsewhere

**Critical question:** What's different about the new context that might break the transfer?

### Combining Frameworks

Often synthesis requires multiple frameworks in sequence:

**Example workflow:**
1. **Systems Thinking** to understand problem structure
2. **Structure-Mapping** to find analogous solutions from other domains
3. **Conceptual Blending** to combine insights into novel approach
4. **Transfer Learning** to adapt solution to current context
5. **Integrative Thinking** to resolve any contradictions that emerge

The frameworks are complementary tools, not competing alternatives. Use whichever helps make progress on the synthesis task at hand.
