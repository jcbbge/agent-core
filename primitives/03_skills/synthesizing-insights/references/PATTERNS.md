### Network Effects

**Structure:** Value increases with number of participants; each new participant benefits existing participants.

**Examples:**
- Communication platforms: More users = more valuable
- Marketplaces: More buyers attract sellers, more sellers attract buyers
- Standards: More adopters make standard more valuable
- Languages: More speakers make language more useful

**Characteristics:**

### Layered Architecture

**Structure:** System organized in hierarchical layers; each layer builds on layer below and provides services to layer above.

**Examples:**
- Software: Operating system → middleware → applications
- Organizations: Front-line → middle management → executives
- Education: Elementary → secondary → higher education
- Protocol stacks: Physical → data link → network → transport → application

**Characteristics:**

### Episodic to Continuous

**Structure:** Infrequent discrete events → ongoing continuous process.

**Examples:**

## Constraint Patterns

Patterns based on limitations and trade-offs.

### CAP Theorem Structure

**Structure:** You can have at most two of three desirable properties; optimizing one weakens others.

**Examples:**
- Distributed systems: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance (pick 2)
- Projects: Fast, Cheap, Good (pick 2)
- Products: Features, Simplicity, Performance (trade-offs required)
- Services: Personalized, Scalable, Affordable (tensions exist)

**Characteristics:**

**Examples:**
- Firefighting: Constant crisis response prevents preventive work
- Technical debt: Quick hacks accumulate, eventually causing bigger problems
- Addiction: Substance solves immediate discomfort, creates long-term dependency
- Bailouts: Rescue prevents pain, encourages risky behavior

**Characteristics:**
- Short-term relief, long-term harm
- Fundamental solution is neglected or atrophied
- System becomes dependent on fix
- Breaking the cycle requires short-term pain

**When to look for this pattern:** Recurring problems, symptomatic solutions, dependencies.

---

### Reinforcing Feedback

**Structure:** Change amplifies itself through feedback loop.

**Examples:**
- Virtuous cycles: Success → confidence → better performance → more success
- Vicious cycles: Stress → poor sleep → more stress
- Network effects: More users → more value → more users
- Wealth concentration: Capital → returns → more capital

**Characteristics:**

## Problem Cluster Patterns

Patterns where multiple problems appear together.

### Resource Depletion Cluster

**Examples:**
- Personal: Burnout + isolation + lack of direction
- Environmental: Soil depletion + water shortage + biodiversity loss
- Organizational: Employee turnover + low morale + declining quality
- Economic: Wage stagnation + debt accumulation + reduced investment

**Characteristics:**
- Problems appear together, not randomly
- Share common root cause (resource extraction > replenishment)
- Addressing individual symptoms doesn't fix system
- Requires addressing extraction/replenishment balance

**When to look for this pattern:** Multiple correlated problems, systemic issues.

---

### Complexity Spiral

**Structure:** System complexity increases over time as exceptions and edge cases accumulate.

**Examples:**
- Code: Feature additions → increasing complexity → harder to change → more patches → more complexity
- Regulations: New rules → exceptions needed → more rules → more exceptions
- Processes: Additional steps → workarounds → more steps → more workarounds
- Products: Feature bloat → UI complexity → more features to address complexity

**Characteristics:**
- Incremental additions seem reasonable individually
- Cumulative effect is overwhelming complexity
- Refactoring/simplification becomes increasingly difficult
- Eventually requires restart or major restructuring

**When to look for this pattern:** Growing complexity, technical debt, process bloat.

## Pattern Recognition Strategies

### How to Identify Patterns in New Situations

**1. Ask structural questions**
- What relates to what?
- What causes what?
- What depends on what?
- What reinforces or balances what?
- What sequences repeat?

**2. Look for familiar shapes**
- Does this structure appear in other domains you know?
- What other systems have similar organization?
- What analogies come to mind?

**3. Test multiple abstractions**
- Describe the situation at different levels of abstraction
- Which level reveals patterns most clearly?
- What's lost and gained at each abstraction level?

**4. Search for common outcomes**
- What problems appear together consistently?
- What transformations follow similar paths?
- What failures have similar root causes?

**5. Use temporal patterns**
- What sequences repeat over time?
- What feedback loops exist?
- Where are delays between action and effect?

### Pattern Validation

Once you've identified a candidate pattern:

**1. Test coverage:** Does the pattern explain all examples, or just some?

**2. Seek counter-examples:** Can you find cases that break the pattern?

**3. Check abstraction level:** Is pattern too specific (won't transfer) or too abstract (not useful)?

**4. Verify causation:** Does pattern identify real causal relationships or just correlations?

**5. Assess utility:** Does recognizing this pattern enable action or just provide description?

### Building Your Own Pattern Library

As you conduct synthesis, capture patterns you discover:

**Pattern template:**
- **Name:** Memorable label
- **Structure:** Core relationships or mechanism
- **Examples:** Concrete instances across domains
- **Characteristics:** Key properties and features
- **Recognition cues:** How to spot this pattern
- **Applicability:** When does this pattern apply or not apply?
- **Implications:** What follows from recognizing this pattern?

Over time, your pattern library becomes a powerful tool for rapid synthesis across domains.
